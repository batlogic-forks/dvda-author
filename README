dvda-author  version 13.10 (Oct 2013)
===========================


1. DESCRIPTION
--------------


dvda-author creates high-definition DVD-Audio disc structures from either WAV,
FLAC/Ogg FLAC (version 1.3.0), or SoX-14.4.1-supported audio formats (.au, .aiff, .gsm, etc.)

This version supports multichannel audio up to 5.1.

It can also create "hybrid" or "universal" DVD-Audio/Video disc structures,
which contain both DVD-Audio and DVD-Video zones.

A navigation feature makes it possible to start playing a video
title from within audio zone or an audio title from within video zone.

Wav header correction, 'gapless' track-to-track playback
and DVD-Audio menus are the latest features to date.

See man page, html page or website for details.

3. BUILD ENVIRONMENT
--------------------

A GNU-style make system is shipped with this package.

Details on building issues are given in INSTALL.


4. FILES
--------

Source code directories are:

  src
      main source code files

  libutils
      Source code for the libc_utils static library

  libats2wav
      Source code for ats2wav, a DVD-Audio titleset extracter that converts .AOB
      files into .wav audio files.

  libfixwav
      Source code for a special library that checks and fixes .wav file headers

  images
      NSIS compiler images for Windows installers.

  libiberty
      GNU libc code for function replacement (alternative to -liberty).

  m4, m4.extra, m4.extra.dvdauthor
      M4 macros, especially:

	dvda.m4                general-purpose macros that could be reused in other projects.
	auxiliary.m4           shorter general-purpose macros.
	dependencies.m4        dvda-author-specific parameters submitted to other M4 macros (using lists).
	sox-debug.m4           used to correct a bug in SoX code.
	iconv.m4, codeset.m4   third-party macros copied here as some platforms may not include it
			       and they are used by nested configure scripts.

Builds are provided in directory 'build' for win32 and linux.

Important DATA-type files are:

  dvda-author.1
      Man(1) page

5. INSTALLATION
---------------

This application performs limited patching of other open source utilities used for creating
audio and video menus (dvdauthor), analyzing audio content (SoX) or creating
a special ISO dic image (mkisofs).

The special patches used in this process are automatically downloaded by the autotools configure
script (see below).

Other building systems will have to make use of the patches available at the following links:

    http://dvd-audio.sourceforge.net/patches/mkisofs/cdrtools-patch-3.00
    http://dvd-audio.sourceforge.net/patches/dvdauthor-patch-0.7.1
    http://dvd-audio.sourceforge.net/patches/sox-patch-14.4.1

See file INSTALL included in this distribution, and COREBUILD for building the core application only.
On *nix platforms, the GNU build system will automatically link to existing libFLAC
libraries, checking for the appropriate version (1.3.0 and later).
If your installed library is not compatible, or on Windows platforms, libFLAC will be
rebuilt from source code in directory libFLAC/

If you do not use the GNU build system, check that the configuration file dvda-author.conf
is in the same directory as the main executable (see INSTALL for other options).
By default, binaries will install under /usr/bin.

This version will use either libiberty.a if already installed on your platform
or source code for a few GNU libc functions located in libiberty/ The list of functions
used depends on platforms.
