<h2 id="aob-headers-for-mlp-input">AOB headers for MLP input</h2>
<p>This is an experimental fork of ffmpeg aimed at importing MLP file layout into dvda-author when input is MLP. This is required to compute PTS and DTS stamps in 64/43 B sector headers of MLP AOBS. Algorithm is as follows:</p>
<p>At each sector of rank (1-based) N of 2048 B, compute :</p>
<ul>
<li>sum S of header size in bytes before N in B (64 + 43 + 43 + ... + 43, N-1 terms)<br />
</li>
<li>total byte size = 2048 * (N-1) -S<br />
</li>
<li>run parallel layout using libffmpeg.a, gives rank of packet and position of packet<br />
</li>
<li>this is given by get_mlp_layout() which returns an MLP_LAYOUT table of at most MAX_AOB_SECTORS<br />
i.e 1024 * 512 lines. Each line has fields pkt_pos, nb_samples and rank.<br />
</li>
<li>pkt_pos is position in MLP file (raw), nb_samples is number of PCM samples in output (raw),<br />
rank is sector rank in AOB (all fields 0-based).<br />
</li>
<li>take rank such that pkt_pos of MLP packet just after start of sector (total byte size)<br />
</li>
<li>nb_samples * c * br = Nbyteswritten<br />
</li>
<li>Nbyteswritten / (c * sr * br) = duration<br />
Or : duration = nb_samples /sr<br />
PTS = ceiling(duration * 90000)<br />
DTS = floor(duration * 90000)<br />
Add :<br />
PTS = PTS + PTS0<br />
DTS = DTS + DTS0<br />
PTS0=105<br />
DTS0=24</li>
</ul>
<p>Write PTS at offset 23 (0-based) on 5 bytes Write DTS at offset 28 (0-based) on 5 bytes First sectors with have PTS starting with 0x31 and DTS with 0x11.</p>
<p><strong>REST OF AOBs is just MLP bytes except for last sector padding (PCM style, TODO)</strong></p>
