FIX BUGS:

Extraction broken for 2/24/(48), ok for 2/16 and multichannel (windows).
Possibly qfact extended headers not supported for 2/24 by players, however ffplay and ffprobe react this way too.

Short term
----------

packaging: include deps as debian packages for mjpegtools and magick at least
(nagging magick config issue)

lplex:
fix issue of aux path binaries: add --bindir option to force local bins
fix 24-bit issue

fix lack of relative paths for -x -o
add sanity check if -o . ! (avoid cur dir erasure...)

Long term
---------

-add options for swift reencoding of VOBS (video import)
-possibly make blank screen subvobs in the event of no pics in some slideshow tracks.
-add multi-vid

link groups
-add automatic import of mono or stereo wavs for multichannel authoring.
