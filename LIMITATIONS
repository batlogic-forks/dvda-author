1. MLP lossless compression is not supported by this project, which make it impossible to author
   all combinations of audio input files that can be found in commercial software,
   notably 24-bit/96kHz, 5.1 channels, which requires MLP.

2. If using slideshows, some players may have trouble when a track does not have pictures associated to it whilst others do have some.
   Some players will stay with the latest picture displayed on screen in the same case, rather than with a blank screen.
   If you do want to display a blank screen for some track, it may be safer to add a blanck screen picture to --stillpics rather than use --, ie:

   --stillpics a.jpg,b.jpg-blankscreen.jpg-c.jpg

   rather than the licit: --stillpics a.jpg,b.jpg--c.jpg

3. For top menu authoring, as of evrsion 10.06 build 300, you may use several slides only if there is just one menu.
   Should you need several menus, the number of slides per menu will automatically be reset to 1.
