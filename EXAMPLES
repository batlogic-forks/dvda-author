DVDA-AUTHOR 10.06 MENU EXAMPLE

To test the new menu capability, create a directory test/ under your personal home directory (on Unix-type platforms) or under a directory named ~ (Windows).
Name three WAV audio files file1.wav, file2.wav, file3.wav under ~/test.
Check your internet connection is functional.
Open a command line window and type in:

./configure --enable-dvdauthor-patch --enable-mkisofs-patch --enable-dvdauthor-build --enable-mkisofs-build && make && make install

If all runs well, you have a patched version of mkisofs and dvdauthor and the Schilling version of cdrecord
installed on your platform (it is recommended to uninstall prior versions of these tools before this step),
with the 10.06 version of dvda-author

Launch:

dvda-author -a -g test/file1.wav test/file2.wav -g test/file3.wav  -o output  --highlight=test/menu1-0.mpg_highlight.png --select=test/menu1-0.mpg_select.png --image=test/menu1-0.mpg_buttons.png    --mkisofs --background-mpg=test/menu1-0.mpg_bg.mpg --workdir ~ 

Burn the iso file generated under ~/output, you may use:

(sudo) cdrecord dev=x,0,0 ~/output/dvd.iso

Once x is known, this step can be integrated to the prior one, by adding --cdrecord x,0,0 to the command line.

with x determined by (sudo) cdrecord -scanbus.

If you are using just one burner, you may omit (dev=)x,0,0 and just add --cdrecord on command line, as the application will guess the right bus code.

Use your remote control's "top menu" button to access the generated top menu, and arrow buttons to navigate between titles.

Several menus
-------------

-i ~/audio --workdir ~/temp  -o dir --topmenu   --nmenus 3 --colors refresh --background ~/Documents/background1.jpg,/home/fab/Documents/background2.jpg,/home/fab/Documents/background3.jpg --cdrecord

will output three menus, each with the background image given by --background. 
If you want to set the number of columns rather than the number of menus, use --ncolumns N  instead of an --nmenus n  option.



DVDA-AUTHOR 10.06 STILLS EXAMPLE

Collect jpg pictures and author them. 
Add them to a directory dir with names pic_000.jpg,...pic_010.jpg,...pic_999.jpg (max).
Use:

--stillpics dir/
Alternatively, you may list pictures:
--stillpics (path0),(path1),...,(pathn)
and add options:
--stilloptions rank=0,starteffect=fade,rank=1,starteffect=dissolve,...

Use exactly as many pictures as there are tracks if using pictures (repeat self-same pics; laxer syntax to be developed).


DVDA-AUTHOR 10.06 CONFIGURATION FILE EXAMPLE

Check the howto HOWTO.conf and the configuration file example dvda-author.conf.example in your package or under your documentation installation folder 
Using the GNU build system, this folder /usr/share/doc/dvda-author/ by default, or $prefix/share/doc/dvda-author if you set --prefix=$prefix at configure stage.

Configuration files are very useful to write complex authoring projects, when command lines get bigger. 
Using the GNU autotools build system, dvda-author.conf is installed under /usr/share/applications/dvda-author.conf or, more generally, under $prefix/share/applications/dvda-author.conf

You may also specify the installation folder for dvda-author.conf using --with-config=/path/to/folder at configure time (see file INSTALL). 
Below is a simple example for a hand-made dvda-author.conf:

[g]  
  a.wav
  b.wav
  c.wav

[g]
  a.aiff
  b.aiff

[sox]

[output]
  outputdir

[topmenu]

[nmenus]
  2

[debug]
